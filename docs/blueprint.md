## Style Guidelines:

- An extremely dark, near-black, sophisticated grey (#080808) for the primary background to provide maximum contrast and minimize eye strain in dark mode.
- A slightly lighter, very cool grey (#1A1A1A) for secondary backgrounds and card elements to offer a subtle distinction without being too bright.
- A crisp, icy blue (#98D8D8) as the accent color for interactive elements, progress indicators, and key data points, delivering a sleek, modern, and highly visible contrast.
- 'Inter' sans-serif, known for its clarity and modern design. Slightly larger font size and increased line height for optimal readability on very dark backgrounds.
- Use simple, filled-style icons in a bright, light color (e.g., #FFFFFF or a pale grey #D3D3D3) to ensure maximum visibility and legibility against the dark backdrop.
- Emphasize a clean, highly structured layout with generous spacing between elements to prevent a cluttered feel. Card-based layouts should be used extensively to group related information logically.
- Incorporate very subtle, smooth transitions and micro-interactions using light colors (e.g., icy blue highlights) to provide user feedback and enhance the user experience, ensuring they are not distracting in a dark environment.
